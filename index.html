            hello, my name is Carl Czarnetzki. I'm a 20-year-old student at the OTH Regensburg,
            where I study General Computer Science in the second semester.
            I'm from Hof an der Saale, but I moved to Regensburg recently.
            On this website I want to share my interests, hobbies and other cool content I like.
            <br>Have fun :)
        </p>

            <h2>electric guitar.</h2>
            <p class="hobby">
                when I was little, my dad gave me a cd with "Band Of Gypsys" by Jimi Hendrix on it.
                Since then, I was hooked on electric guitars. First I learned to play classical guitar, but that got boring
                and after a while I started playing electric guitar. Currently, I got my little set-up with a few paddles, an amp
                and my beloved Fender Stratocaster. Most of the time I just freestyle and have fun, but I'm not nearly where I want to be.
                The funnest part is jamming with friends, although we are just experimenting most of the time.
